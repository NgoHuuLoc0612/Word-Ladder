# Word Ladder Game

A sophisticated web-based word ladder puzzle game where players transform one word into another by changing exactly one letter at a time. Each intermediate step must be a valid English word.

## üéÆ Game Overview

Transform words step by step in this engaging puzzle game! Start with one word and reach the target word by making valid single-letter changes. Challenge yourself against AI opponents or play with friends.

**Example:** CAT ‚Üí COT ‚Üí DOT ‚Üí DOG

## ‚ú® Features

### Game Modes
- **Player vs Player (PvP)**: Compete against another human player
- **AI vs Player**: Challenge yourself against intelligent AI opponents
- **AI vs AI**: Watch AI algorithms compete against each other

### AI Difficulty Levels
- **Easy**: Makes occasional suboptimal moves with basic strategy
- **Medium**: Uses greedy approach with 2-step lookahead
- **Hard**: Employs A* pathfinding with strategic blocking
- **Expert**: Advanced minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning

### Advanced Features
- **Multiple Pathfinding Algorithms**: A*, Bidirectional BFS, Dijkstra
- **Smart Heuristics**: Hamming distance, Levenshtein distance, character frequency analysis
- **AI Strategy**: Blocking moves, optimal path calculation, position evaluation
- **Game Statistics**: Timer, move counter, score calculation
- **Hint System**: Get helpful suggestions when stuck
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Web server (for local development) or static hosting service

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/word-ladder.git
cd word-ladder
```

2. **Set up word list:**
   - Create a `wordlist.txt` file in the root directory
   - Add one word per line (see Word List Format section)
   - Or download a pre-made word list from various online sources

3. **Run the game:**
   - **Option A**: Use a local web server
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   
   # Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
   npx http-server
   ```
   
   - **Option B**: Deploy to a static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)

4. **Open your browser:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or your hosting URL)

## üéØ How to Play

1. **Select Game Mode**: Choose between Player vs Player, AI vs Player, or AI vs AI
2. **Set Words**: Enter start and end words (must be same length) or use "Random Words"
3. **Choose Difficulty**: Select AI difficulty level if playing against computer
4. **Start Playing**: Take turns entering valid words that differ by exactly one letter
5. **Win Condition**: First player to reach the target word wins!

### Game Rules
- Words must be the same length as the start word
- Each move must change exactly one letter
- All intermediate words must be valid English words
- No word can be repeated in the same game
- Players alternate turns (except in AI vs AI mode)

## üîß Word List Format

Create a `wordlist.txt` file with one word per line:

```
cat
cot
dot
dog
bat
bag
big
...
```

**Supported Formats:**
- Simple word lists: `word`
- Dictionary format: `word (definition)` - definitions are automatically stripped

**Recommendations:**
- Include 3-8 letter words for best gameplay
- Ensure good connectivity between words
- Common word lists: SOWPODS, TWL, or custom curated lists

## ü§ñ AI Algorithm Details

### Pathfinding Algorithms
- **A* Search**: Optimal pathfinding with multiple heuristics
- **Bidirectional BFS**: Faster search by exploring from both ends
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Guaranteed shortest path finding

### Heuristics
- **Hamming Distance**: Number of differing character positions
- **Levenshtein Distance**: Minimum edit distance between words
- **Character Frequency**: Difference in letter distributions

### AI Strategies
- **Easy**: Random moves with 30% suboptimal choice rate
- **Medium**: Greedy selection with 2-step lookahead
- **Hard**: Strategic blocking with path optimization
- **Expert**: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning (4-ply depth)

## üé® Customization

### Styling
Modify `style.css` to customize:
- Color schemes and themes
- Animations and transitions
- Layout and typography
- Responsive breakpoints

### Game Logic

    this.players.player2.isAI = true;
    // Configure mode-specific settings
    break;
```

2. **Custom AI Strategy:**
```javascript
// In algorithm.js
selectCustomMove(currentWord, targetWord, difficulty) {
    // Implement your strategy
    return bestMove;
}
```

3. **New Heuristic:**
```javascript
// In algorithm.js
customHeuristic(word1, word2) {
    // Calculate custom distance metric
    return distance;
}
```

### Testing
